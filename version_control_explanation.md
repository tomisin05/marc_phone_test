# Explanation About Version Control Limitations

I apologize, but I am unable to revert the code to how it was 3 iterations ago. This is because:

1. Each interaction with me starts fresh - I don't maintain any history of previous changes or iterations
2. I don't have access to version control systems like Git that would allow reverting changes
3. Each time you start a new conversation with me, it begins with a clean slate showing the current state of your codebase

If you need to revert changes, I recommend:

1. Using Git if your code is version controlled (git revert or git reset commands)
2. Restoring from any backups you may have
3. Manually undoing the specific changes you want to reverse by telling me what specific code changes you'd like to revert

Please let me know if you'd like help with any of those approaches instead.
